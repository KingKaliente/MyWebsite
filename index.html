    <p> Hello! My name is Mario Soriano!</p>
    <p>
      I am a student and a rising developer working to reach my dream as a game developer or designer! 
      I am interested in the fields of computer science and game design/development.
    <p/>
    <p>  Take a look at some of the projects I have helped make during my time at Pasadena High School! </p>

        <p class="project-description">
          My friend and I made the game BlackJack on Replit, an online coding platform, 
          using Python. It has a simple design with just lines of text. We used multiple 
          libraries for the deck of cards and to simulate the hand for both the player 
          and the computer. We used functions for everything else like shuffling the deck, 
          starting the game, and even giving the computer a basic AI so it would draw cards 
          if the value of its hand is lower than 16.

          My team and I made a 2d platformer game called 
          Speedrun Mayem. We made using Godot in less than 24 hours. It was 
          It's supposed to be a fast-paced game for speedrunners as the name implies. 
          The player would have access to items/gear that would give the player 
          different movement options for example a shield that gives the player 
          an extra dash or a bow that functions as a grappling hook.

            My friend and I made this top-down shooter 
            game with Godot. We did not make the character

            This project was made during class with everyone to learn how to make a game in Replit. 
           I learned to define and call functions and use if and for statements.
           This simple project also showed how much code goes into simple games and how every line matters.
